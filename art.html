				National Velvet (1963, Silver paint, silkscreen ink, and graphite on linen).
				Elizabeth Taylor was one of Warhol's favorite celebrity subjects. He made dozens of paintings of the actress after seeing a 1962 Life magazine cover story
				that chronicled her well-publicized romances. It included the picture seen here of Taylor in National Velvet, the 1944 film that launched her to stardom as
				a young girl. Warhol combined the natural variations of the skilkscreen process with subtle, deliverate manipulations so that each picture would have its
				own unique character. In this work the first iteration, visible at upper left, is the most complete and photographic, while the last one, at lower right,
				is like a faded apparition.
